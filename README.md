Sqr Problm: [[Clck]](https://ioinformatics.org/files/ioi1991round1.pdf);
this one is simple, nice, short, and sweet;
It doesn't need much commenting, except probably that I've
borrow the idea for the extended matrix from Chess Programming,
where the board is customary represented as a *-1* framed *12x12* matrix
to handle Knight moves:), by the way this is my first Java program and
I think not the last:)
